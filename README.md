## AIM & OBJECTIVES
**At the end of this project we should be able:**

- To know how the shell works
- To be able to explain to anyone the concepts applied in building the simple shell
- To know the creator of the unix process

## COMPILATION
**The shell should be compiled this way:** <br>
`gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89 *.c -o hsh` <br>

## PROCESSES IMPLEMENTED
